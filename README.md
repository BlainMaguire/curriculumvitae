# Curriculum Vitae
My CV/resume in LaTex along with the generated PDF.

## Details 

I'm using res.cls. I got it from here: 

http://www.rpi.edu/dept/arc/training/latex/resumes/

On that site are many templates using it to choose from - I picked res9b.tex as a base and customized it.
The LaTex for github/linkedin icons is not my own, I found both on stackexchange from google searches.

## Why do this?

A CV/resume is basically just text. So why not keep it in version control? Secondly, people have asked me about the layout/template multiple times. Providing the source files along with relevant information in one place makes it easier for everyone.
